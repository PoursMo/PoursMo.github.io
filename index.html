    Welcome to my portfolio. I'm Amaury Loubry, a certified Unity Programmer in C# looking to get professional experience to start my career as a freelancer.<br>
    I started using Unity in November 2020, working on small projects to learn by myself.<br>
    In 2022, I followed a 6 month course for Unity and C#, and I recently passed the exam to become a Certified Unity Associate Programmer.<br>
    Outside of work, my hobbies and interests include: cooking, traveling, music production, and board/video gaming.
    <br><br>
    Feel free to explore my works within and to contact me with any questions, collaborations, etc.
