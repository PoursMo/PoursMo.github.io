title: Certified Associate Programmer Course
---
<p>
    I took a course developed by Unity and coupled with Event Orizon mentorship to prepare for the Unity Associate: Programmer Certification.<br>
    The course was divided in 4 modules that had challenges, solutions, and quizzes, allowing me to solidify and expand my knowledge.
</p>


<h3>Platformer</h3>

<p>
    The first module of the course was done on a 3D Platformer game. The scene was already made with the level design done.
    The goal of the module was to troubleshoot and debug scripts that were not doing what they were intended to do.

<h3>Ski Game</h3>

<p>
    The remaining three modules were based around a ski game.
    The goal of two out of the three modules was to create a ski game where the player
    would ski down a slope and slalom around flags against a timer.<br />
    Similar to the first module, I had to debug some already existing code,
    but this time I also had to create my own code to add functionalities to the game.

    The last module's objective was to create a UI for the title screen and when the player reaches the end of the run.
    The buttons allowed to navigate through the scenes, quit the game with a confirmation prompt, and mute/unmute the music.
