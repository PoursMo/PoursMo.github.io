title: Unity & C# Fundamentals
---
<p>
    I had the unique opportunity to follow self-paced course developed by a
    Event Orizon which purpose was to teach the fundamentals of Unity and C#.
    The course was divided in 3 projects described below. For each project, a series of relevant tutorials were presented,
    as well as a weekly one-on-one meeting with a mentor professionally trained in Unity and C# for guidance and questions.<br>
    I already had some knowledge in both Unity and C# when I followed this course, which allowed me to finish the first 2 projects quickly.
</p>

<h3>First Project</h3>

<p>
    The first project was using Unity's
    <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-game-kit">2D Game Kit</a>.
    Its main objective was to get accustomed to Unity's interface and learn its components through customisation and usage of the software.<br>
    No coding was done for this project, only placing GameObjects and editing properties in the Inspector.

<h3>Second Project</h3>

<p>
    The second project was done in Visual Studio only with
    <a target="_blank" href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks">.NET SDK</a>.
    The objective was to code the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)">Hangman Game</a>
    using C#, to learn and practice with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
    The game would track the letters the player already tried and allow for replay.<br>
    I added 2 different game modes : 1) single player where the word to guess would be a randomly chosen word from a list.
    2) multiplayer where the Player 1 would type in the word for the Player 2 to guess.<br>
    The hangman figure was drawn using
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art">ASCII art.</a>

<h3>Third Project</h3>

<p>
    The third and last project's goal was to put into practice the knowledge acquired in the previous projects,
    while still incorportating new skills in both C# and Unity.<br>
    The objective was to create a 3D platformer game where the player must pick up as many coins as possible in a limited amount of time.<br>
    There were 3 different coin types with different chance of spawning on generation, and each giving a different amount of points.
    The player could fall off the platforms and would be teleported back to the starting position.<br>
    Beyond the basic objectives, there were some additional aspects of the game that I incorporated as well to illustrate other coding skills :
    An enemy would follow the player, slowing them down when touching.
    The player could pick up a pink ball to throw at the enemy to make it go in another direction.<br>
    A booster item was added, with a low chance of spawning on each platform. When the player would walk on it,
    they would get a movement speed upgrade for a short amount of time.<br>
    I also added some post-processing using Unity High Definition Render Pipeline to start learning about post-processing.
