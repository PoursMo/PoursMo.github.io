title: Junior Programmer Pathway
---
<p>
    When I was preparing for the Associate: Programmer Certification, I followed the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer">Unity Junior Programmer Pathway</a>
    to make sure I maintained my grasp on the basics of programming with C# in Unity.<br />
    The course is divided in 5 Units that focus on different aspects :<br /><br />

    - Unit 1 "Player Control", where I programmed a car moving side-to-side on a floating road,
    with obstacles that use Unity's built-in physics system and are in the way of the car.<br /><br />

    - Unit 2 "Basic Gameplay", where I programmed a top-down game with hungry animals stampeding from top to bottom of the screen.
    The player could move left to right and throw food at the animals to make them disappear.<br /><br />

    - Unit 3 "Sound and Effects", where I programmed an endless side-scolling runner game.
    The player would run towards obstacles and had to time their jumps to avoid them.
    The goal of this Unit was to add music, sound effects, and use the particle system for visual effects.<br /><br />

    - Unit 4 "Gameplay Mechanics", where I programmed an arcade-style Sumo battle
    where the player would have to push increasingly difficult waves of enemies off of a floating island.
    I also programmed a power up that would give the player a temporary advantage.<br /><br />

    - Unit 5 "User Interface", where I programmed a game where objects would be tossed in the air and
    the player has to click on them to destroy them before they fall off the screen.
    The goal of this Unit was to implement a User Interface (UI) with a title screen to choose from 3 different difficulties and
    a game over screen with a restart button
