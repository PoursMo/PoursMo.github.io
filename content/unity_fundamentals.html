title: Unity & C# Fundamentals
---
<p>
    I followed a course which purpose was to teach the fundamentals of Unity and C#.
    The course was divided in 3 projects described below.<br>
    I already had some knowledge in both Unity and C# when I followed this course, which allowed me to finish the first 2 projects quickly.
</p>

<h3>First Project</h3>

<p>
    The first project was using Unity's
    <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-game-kit">2D Game Kit.</a>
    It's goal is to get people used to Unity and learn the main components of it, namely the different windows. <br>
    No coding was done for this project, only placing GameObject and editing properties in the Inspector.

<h3>Second Project</h3>

<p>
    The second project was done in Visual Studio only with
    <a target="_blank" href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks">.NET SDK.</a>
    The objective was to create the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)">Hangman game</a>
    using C#, with the possiblity to replay, and tracking the letters the player already tried.
    I added 2 different gamemodes, single player where the word to guess would be a randomly chosen word from a list,
    and multiplayer where the first player would type in the word for the second player to guess.
    The hangman is drawn using

<h3>Third Project</h3>

<p>
    The third and last project's goal was to put into practice the knowledge acquired in the previous projects,
    while still learning new things in both C# and Unity
