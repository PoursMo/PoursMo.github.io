title: Procedural Dungeon Generation
---
<p>
    When I decided I wanted this game to be a Roguelite, one of the first thing I wanted was to
    implement a procedural dungeon generation algorithm. <br>
    My goal was to generate a set of randomly chosen rooms from an array of room
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html">prefabs</a>
    and interconnect them in such a way that every room is reachable, but there are only certain paths available to use<br>
    After doing some research, I liked the approach used for the game "TinyKeep", described in
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dlwc4/procedural_dungeon_generation_algorithm_explained/">
        a 10 year old reddit post.
    </a><br>
    I used the steps outlined here as a guide, adapting them to the vision I had in mind for my game.
</p>

<h3>Step 1 : Generating rooms</h3>

<p>
    First, I instantiate the room prefabs. Each room is created on a random position inside a circle.

<h3>Step 2 : Separation Steering Behavior</h3>

<p>
    I now separate the rooms using
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/">Craig Reynolds' separation steering behavior for autonomous characters</a>
    until there is no overlap.<br>
    I added a "space between rooms" parameter to change the overlap size of the rooms to space them out.

<h3>Step 3 : Delaunay Triangulation</h3>

<p>
    We now want to create a graph that connects all the rooms together without intersecting lines.
    This is done using
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation">
        Delaunay Triangulation.
    </a><br>
    I created 3 structs :<br>
    - An "Edge" struct made of 2 vertices.<br>
    - A "Triangle" struct made of 3 vertices and 3 edges.<br>
    - A "Circle" struct simply made of a center (Vector3) and a radius value.
    This struct is used to store the circumcircle of the triangles when doing the triangulation.<br>
    The triangulation is done by adding points (in our case, rooms) one by one to the triangulation,
    checking if it is in the circumcircle of any triangle in the triangulation. If it is, we remove those triangles
    and create new ones with the added point.

<h3>Step 4 : Spanning Tree</h3>

<p>
    Now, all the rooms are connected to their neighbors, which results in an uninteresting dungeon with too many paths.
    So I created a
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree">minimal spanning tree</a>
    from the graph obtained with the triangulation.<br>
    The spanning tree will make it so that there is always only 1 possible path from one room to another.
    A spanning tree is a graph that will always include all of the rooms, making them all reachable.<br>
    I created a "Graph" struct to store vertices and edges.<br>
    Using Prim's algorithm, I built this tree one vertex at a time,
    starting with the first vertex (room), at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex in the triangulated graph.

<h3>Step 5 : Adding Cycles</h3>

<p>
    The tree contains no cycles, which makes the dungeon not very interesting. So I loop through all the edges from the triangulated graph,
    and if it's not part of the tree I give it a 15% chance of being re-incorporated.

<h3>Result</h3>

<p>
    Final result, a randomly generated set of rooms with a path (red graph).
