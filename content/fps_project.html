<p>
    After taking the
    <a target="_blank" href="/content/unity_fundamentals.html">fundamentals course in Unity and C#</a>,
    I started working on a first-person puzzle game with some inspiration from the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(series)">Portal games</a>.<br />
    In this game, the player is required to navigate from point A to point B using their "telegun" that allows them to pick up a ball and throw it.
    After the ball is thrown,
    the player can teleport to the position of the ball. This is used to solve puzzles to reach the end of the level.<br /><br />
    I created different material types for the walls with which the ball interacts differently : blue and green.
    the ball stops when it comes into contact with a blue wall, whereas it bounces off a green wall.<br /><br />
    I also added different types of interactable objects :
    The ball itself is interactable at the beginning of the level so that the player can pick it up.
    A button can be pressed to trigger any function using
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Events.UnityEvent.html">Unity Event system</a>,
    such as opening a door.
    A vessel can receive the ball from the player to open the last door of the level.<br /><br />
    I learned to use
    <a target="_blank" href="https://unity.com/features/probuilder">Pro Builder</a>
    to build the level of the game and the basics of
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>
    to create the vessel.
