<p>
    After finishing my course on the Fundamentals of Unity & C#,
    I started working on a first person puzzle game with some inspiration from the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(series)">Portal games.</a><br />
    In this game, the player has to use a ball that can be picked up and thrown using his gun. After the ball is thrown,
    the player can teleport at the position of the ball. This is used to solve puzzles to reach the end of the level.<br /><br />
    I created different material types for the walls : blue is sticky so when the ball touches it, it stops instantly.
    Green is bouncy so can be used to throw the ball in places that wouldn't be accessible otherwise.<br /><br />
    I also added different types of interactable objects :
    The ball itself is interactable at the beginning of the level so that the player can pick it up.<br />
    A button that can be pressed to trigger any function using
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Events.UnityEvent.html">Unity Event system,</a>
    such as opening a door.<br />
    A vessel where the player would put the ball to open the last door of the level.<br /><br />
    I learned to use
    <a target="_blank" href="https://unity.com/features/probuilder">Pro Builder</a>
    to build the level of the game, and the basics of
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>
    to create the vessel.
