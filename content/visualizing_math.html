<p>
    I followed some tutorials from 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/">Catlike Coding's Basics tutorials</a>, 
    which gave me an introduction to shaders and the 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://unity.com/srp/universal-render-pipeline">Universal Render Pipeline (URP)</a>.<br />
    The objective was to show mathematical functions by drawing cubes, and animate them over time.
    The cubes' material uses a custom shader that changes color depending on its position in the world.<br />
    I added a 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil_knot">Trefoil knot</a>
    as an extra personal challenge.
