<p>
    The combat in this game is melee-oriented with the plater using a katana to damage and kill enemies.<br />
    The player can parry to reduce the damage taken, and if the parry is done with the proper timing,
    it becomes a "perfect parry" and the player takes no damage at all.<br />
    I added a lock-on system so it's possible to lock on an enemy;
    this will make it so that the player character always faces the locked enemy and a green dot will indicate which enemy is locked.<br /><br />

    I created scripts for enemies that I can reuse on any enemy with 2 variants : one for a mobile enemy that will follow the player using
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/nav-NavigationSystem.html">Unity's Navigation System</a>,
    and another one for immobile enemies.<br />
    Thus far, I have added a mutant enemy using the models and animations from
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mixamo.com/">Mixamo</a>, and gave him the mobile script.
    It has 2 different attacks that will trigger depending on how close the player is.
