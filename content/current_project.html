<p>
    This is my most recent project. The idea is to create a roguelite (a
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">Roguelike</a>
    with progression elements that persists even after failure) based on melee combat.<br><br />
    My objective for the game is to have the player progress through procedurally generated levels, finding power-ups
    that will make them stronger for the current run they're on.
    I also want to add a boss fight with telegraphed attacks and make the combat system simple, reactive, and one that rewards skill (like a
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soulslike">Soulslike</a>).<br><br />
    Check out the subcategories of this project to see what I have worked on so far.
