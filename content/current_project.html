<p>
    This is my most recent project. The idea is to create a roguelite (a 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">roguelike</a>
    with progression elements that persists even after failure) based on melee combat with the possiblity to parry enemy attacks.<br>
    The player would progress through procedurally generated levels and find powerups on the way.<br>
    Feel free to go check out the subcategories of this project to see what I worked on so far.
