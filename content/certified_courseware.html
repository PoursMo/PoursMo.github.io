title: Certified Associate Programmer Course
---
<p>
    I took a course developed by Unity and coupled with Event Orizon mentorship to prepare for the Unity Associate: Programmer Certification.
    It allowed me to get more practice, solidify and expand my knowledge.<br>
    The course was divided in 4 modules that had challenges, solutions, and quizzes.
</p>


<h3>Platformer</h3>

<p>
    The first module of the course was  3D Platformer. The scene were already made with level design done,
    the goal of the module was to debug code that was not doing what it was intended to do.

<h3>Ski Game</h3>

<p>
    The 3 remaining modules were done on a Ski Game.
    The goal was to create a ski game where the player would slide down a slope and slalom around flags with a timer.<br />
    Similar to the first module I had to debug some already existing code,
    but this time I also had to create my own code to add functionalities to the game.

    The last module's objective was to create a UI for the titlescreen of the game and when the player reaches the end of the run.
    The buttons allowed to navigate through the scenes, quit the game with a confirmation prompt, and mute/unmute the music.
